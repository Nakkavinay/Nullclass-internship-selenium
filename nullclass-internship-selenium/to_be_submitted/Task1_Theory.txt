TASK 1 - SELENIUM WEBDRIVER THEORY

===========================================
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN driver.get() AND driver.navigate().to()
===========================================

QUESTION: Explain the difference between driver.get() and driver.navigate().to() in Selenium WebDriver

ANSWER:

1. driver.get() METHOD
   - Primary method for navigating to a webpage
   - Loads a new page completely and waits for full page load
   - Clears browser history and cache for the session
   - More reliable for initial page loads
   - Syntax: driver.get("https://www.amazon.in");

2. driver.navigate().to() METHOD
   - Part of Navigation interface for browser navigation
   - Navigates to page but maintains browser history
   - May not wait for complete page load
   - Allows use of back(), forward(), refresh() methods
   - Syntax: driver.navigate().to("https://www.amazon.in");

KEY DIFFERENCES:
- History Management: navigate().to() maintains history, get() doesn't
- Page Loading: get() ensures complete page load
- Additional Methods: navigate() provides back(), forward(), refresh()
- Performance: get() is generally more reliable for initial loads

WHEN TO USE:
- Use driver.get(): For initial page loads, guaranteed loading
- Use driver.navigate().to(): When maintaining history is needed
